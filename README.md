# DrumRollz 🥁

Bring out the drummer in you !

## Goal

Create an app with 4 buttons - each play different drum effects when pressed.

## Learning Goals

1. Learn how to add audio files to project
2. Learn how to interact with Audio Files - Play Audio File
3. Create 1 IBAction for different buttons and identify why button called the action

## My Approach

1. Created a Xcode project and designed the app using StoryBoard.
2. Downloaded some free to use drum sound effects.
3. Add the .mp3 files to project

4. Linked all the buttons (drums) to single `IBAction` - `keyPressed`
5. Found a way to identify which button (drum) has triggered the action - `keyPressed`
   - `sender.titleLabel?.text ?? ""`
6. The link mentioned in point 3 also had the snippet on how to play the file - tweaked a little bit as per my requirement and used it to play some dope drum beats !
7. Created and added app icons.
8. 🥁 🥁 🥁 🥁 🥁 ....... Done !
